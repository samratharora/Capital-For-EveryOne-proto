// The microphone as Dial's surfaces use it: the shared voice engine plus the person's choice of where their voice is
// turned into text. Nothing listens in the background, and the microphone always opens inside the person's own click,
// so the browser's permission prompt appears straight away.
//
// Tapping the microphone:
//   - not chosen yet: asks first (VoiceConsent): the browser's online speech service, on this device only, or typing.
//     Nothing listens and no audio leaves until the person picks one. The choice is saved; Display and voice changes it.
//   - chose typing: offers the choice again, rather than leaving voice off with no way back.
//   - chose "on this device only", but the browser doesn't have it: offers the choice with a plain explanation.
//   - chose the online service, or on-device is installed: starts listening.
