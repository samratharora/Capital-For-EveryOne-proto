// CONTRACT (Dial 2.0, owned by the lead; changes need agreeing with every workstream that imports it).
//
// One pipeline for typed and spoken input:
//
//   text or Utterance ─► correct() ─► segment() ─► plan() ─► DialStep[] ─► runner (trusted app code) ─► UI
//                                                     │
//                                                     └─► "ask" steps only ─► askDial() ─► /api/ask (Groq)
//
// plan() is pure and deterministic. It never calls the network, never touches money and never returns code.
// Every step it returns is a member of DialStep and passes validateStep() before the runner executes it.
// Groq never sees this contract and never chooses a step: it only words answers to "ask" steps on the server.
