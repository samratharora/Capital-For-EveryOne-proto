// Credit building, worked out from the card alone. Pure, integer pence, no AI: every figure the credit coach shows or

//
// What it does NOT do: predict a credit score. UK credit reference agencies each use their own models and don't publish
// how much each factor weighs, so the coach only explains the habits that are widely agreed to help (paying on time,
// using a small share of the limit, staying under the limit) and shows exactly where this card stands on each.
// The 25% guide follows Experian UK's advice to keep credit use below 25% of the limit.
